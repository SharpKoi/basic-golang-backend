# Golang Backend Example - Social Media

This project is written in[ Go](https://go.dev/), following the course: **Social Media Backend in Go**, provided by [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/courses/cs-track) team. Using the `net/http` package from golang standard library and json files as the database to build a simple social media backend. 

You can find more informations on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev/courses/cs-track) and take lots of useful courses from there ðŸ¤©.

## TODO

These Ideas below are from [the final section](https://boot.dev/project/709a2e74-eb45-46ea-ac26-4b8e6a3ce3e6/ec5c7007-8ed2-4e17-a9c9-c54007d0e0fb) of the course, for extending the backend program.

- [ ] Use PostgresQL instead of a JSON file for the database layer
- [ ] Allow users to save other data with their posts
- [ ] Add proper authentication to each request, may use the [password validator](https://github.com/wagslane/go-password-validator) designed by Lane
- [ ] Add more unit tests
- [ ] Deploy the API on AWS, GCP, or Digital Ocean
- [ ] Dockerize it
- [ ] Add documentation using markdown files
- [ ] Write a frontend that interacts with the API, maybe a webpage or a mobile app

 And these ideas below are mine

- [ ] Write a full guide for the backend API designing
- [ ] Integrate with discord bot
